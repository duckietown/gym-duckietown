# The following section defines the grid layout.
#
# Each row is an array of tiles descriptions.
# The top-left tile in this file maps to coordinates (0, 0) in the world
# Each tile contains a string with the kind of tile and its orientation.
# The orientations are North, South, East, West. This is the direction in
# which the agent is expected to drive when going onto this tile.
