# Each row is an array of tiles
# The top-left tile in this file maps to coordinates (0, 0) in the world
# The first coordinate corresponds to the column index, second to the row index
# Each tile contains a string with the kind of tile and its orientation
tiles:
- [diag_left/3  , linear/3          , 3way_left/3       , linear_stop/3     , linear/3    , diag_left/2]
- [linear/0     , asphalt           , linear_stop_both/2, asphalt           , asphalt     , linear/2]
- [3way_left/0  , linear_stop_both/3, 3way_left/2       , asphalt           , asphalt     , linear/2]
- [linear_stop/0, asphalt           , linear_stop_both/2, asphalt           , diag_right/2, diag_left/1]
- [diag_left/0  , linear_stop/1     , 3way_left/1       , linear_stop_left/1, diag_left/1 , empty]

# Object positions are scaled according to the tile size, so that (1.5, 2.5)
# would be exactly in the middle of tile (1, 2)
# Objects can be scaled according to their real-world height in meters
# Duckietown tiles are 61cm, or 0.61 meter
